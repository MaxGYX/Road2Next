I really hope Phoenix Suns can win the championship this year！

#### GO Devin Booker！
[2025.04.11]So disappointed that the Suns didn't even make the playoffs. Goodbye Durant, even Booker staying in Phoenix next season becomes a luxury! 

[2024.04.25]I can't believe the Suns have been defeated by the Timberwolves in two consecutive games, but I still believe Devin Booker will turn the tide! 

[2024.04.30]I feel so bad, the Suns need to rebuild. A balance between offense and defense is much more important than super-players. See you next season!
